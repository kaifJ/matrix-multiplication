# Matrix multiplication
Multiply the three matrices: A, B, and C;  i.e., you are expected to find the matrix D where D=(A*B)*C.  A, B, and, C contain random numbers in the range of (0,1) and the dimensions of the matrices are as follows.  A is a matrix with dimension 106  x 103 .  B is a matrix with dimension 103  x 106 . C is a matrix with dimension 106  x 1 .
